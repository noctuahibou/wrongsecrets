This challenge can be solved using the following ways:

- Get the data of the sidecar by looking at the files created by Vault Agent sidecar:
  1. Run `kubectl get pods -A` and find secret-challenge-xxx pod name
  2. Run `kubectl exec secret-challenge-xxx -c secret-challenge -n default -- cat /vault/secrets/challenge47` where `xxx` is the rest of the randomly generated pod name to print the hardcoded value used by the developer.

- Get the data by checking the logs of the Wrongsecrets pod as the export is being sourced:
  1. Run `kubectl get pods -A` and find secret-challenge-xxx pod name
  2. Run `kubectl logs secret-challenge-xxx -c vault-agent` where `xxx` is the rest of the randomly generated pod name to print the logs from the Vault AGent sidecar, which will include logging the export statement.

Note: if you are running this on a hosted environment, where you do not have access to the Kubernetes cluster, ask the organizer of the hosted solution to execute the commands for you and return the results.
