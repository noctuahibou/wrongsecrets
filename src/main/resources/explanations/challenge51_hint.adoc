This challenge can be solved using the following ways:

- *Acme Inc*. has a misconfigured `challenge51docker-compose.yml` file where sensitive information is exposed. Your task is to find these vulnerabilities.
  1. Clone the repository containing the challenge files.
  2. Locate the `challenge51docker-compose.yml` file in the repository and navigate to that location.
  3. Identify credentials:
    Within the environments section in challenge51docker-compose.yml, check for variables like:
     * `db_user`
     * `db_password`
     * `db_name`
  4. Now you can run the Docker Compose commands to build and run your service:
     * `export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`
     * `docker compose -f challenge51docker-compose.yml build`
     * `docker compose -f challenge51docker-compose.yml run myservice`
  5. The answer is in the output
